        Select a Drug coverage PDF and upload to break the document up and store in a vector model.  They use OpenAI to leverage LLM's to understand questions and look for similar answers in the PDF data. Then "ask" the bot a question about the coverage.

        - _What is the J code?_
        - _Is there a pre authorization needed?_
        - *What is the duration of coverage?*
        - _etc..._
        ### How to use the demo

        1. Go to the "Coverage Files" tab and either select a coverage file that has been uploaded previously or upload a new file.
        2. Click on the "Chat" tab and let the model load into memory and then start asking questions.

        The purpose of this demo is to prototype different types of document parsing and embedding strategies while collecting typical "questions" we have about the coverage information.
